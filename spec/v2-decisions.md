# v2: the user's decisions

Answers to the open questions in `spec/rebuild-v2.md` Part 5. Where this file and the plan
disagree, this file wins. Builders read it alongside the plan and `spec/v2-upgrades/`.

1. **Daily Challenge: twins.** Every student gets the same ten question types in the same
   order, each with their own numbers, so answers cannot be passed around. (Open question 3,
   the default.)
2. **Words: SAT Reading & Writing (EBRW) vocabulary only, for now.** Ship the SAT word list
   and transitions -- no "Math language" deck. (Open question 2.) The reason is the roadmap
   below: Words is the first piece of EBRW on the site.
3. **Roadmap: the full SAT, later.** The site stays Math-first while the Reading & Writing
   question bank is built. When there are thousands of EBRW items, the platform expands to
   the full SAT (both sections, 1600 scale, R&W practice, tests and reports). Build v2 so that
   expansion is additive: subject-aware data and routes where it costs little, no Math-only
   assumptions baked into shared components that would have to be torn out.
4. **No visual budget.** "We are not limiting ourselves visually to miss on functionality...
   as long as we have useful functionality, we can use however much elements, space, and
   whatnot." A useful feature, stat, control, filter, panel or explanation is never cut,
   collapsed away or hidden to save space or look lighter. Pages may be as long and as dense
   as the functionality needs; organise it (sections, tabs, sticky bars, tables) rather than
   remove it. The only test for leaving something out is that it does not help a student.
