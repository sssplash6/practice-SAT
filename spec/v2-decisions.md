# v2: the user's decisions

Answers to the open questions in `spec/rebuild-v2.md` Part 5. Where this file and the plan
disagree, this file wins. Builders read it alongside the plan and `spec/v2-upgrades/`.

## 2026-09-23

1. **Daily Challenge: twins.** Every student gets the same ten question types in the same
   order, each with their own numbers, so answers cannot be passed around. (Open question 3,
   the default.)
2. **Words: SAT Reading & Writing (EBRW) vocabulary only, for now.** Ship the SAT word list
   and transitions -- no "Math language" deck. (Open question 2.) The reason is the roadmap
   below: Words is the first piece of EBRW on the site.
3. **Roadmap: the full SAT, later.** The site stays Math-first while the Reading & Writing
   question bank is built. When there are thousands of EBRW items, the platform expands to
   the full SAT (both sections, 1600 scale, R&W practice, tests and reports). Build v2 so that
   expansion is additive: subject-aware data and routes where it costs little, no Math-only
   assumptions baked into shared components that would have to be torn out.
4. **No visual budget.** "We are not limiting ourselves visually to miss on functionality...
   as long as we have useful functionality, we can use however much elements, space, and
   whatnot." A useful feature, stat, control, filter, panel or explanation is never cut,
   collapsed away or hidden to save space or look lighter. Pages may be as long and as dense
   as the functionality needs; organise it (sections, tabs, sticky bars, tables) rather than
   remove it. Something belongs if it helps a student study, OR if it makes the site clearer,
   more straightforward or more convenient to use (the user, same day: "not only if it helps to
   study, but even if it makes things clear, straightforward, and very convenient to use") --
   shortcuts, previews, confirmations of what will happen, visible state, counts, legends,
   explanations of a number, one-tap ways to the next step. The only reason to leave something
   out is that it does none of these.
5. **No classes.** "We have a separate platform for classes, drop it." Task S2 (Classes and
   homework, Shell spec §7) is removed: no teacher or student roles, classes, homework,
   assignments, class codes, `/class/` or `/join/` pages, class leaderboards or teacher views,
   and no data or endpoints for them. Anything elsewhere in the plan or the upgrades that
   depends on classes goes too. Compete keeps private contests, but not through classes: a
   private contest is an invite code or link that Compete owns (friends competing together),
   with no teacher or homework features. Resolution R4 of the plan ("Compete's groups are the
   same thing as classes") is void.

6. **No College Board Student-bank features (2026-09-27).** The public Question Bank index in `material/cb/cb_index.json`
   (3,770 questions with subject, domain, skill, difficulty and band) covers what we need: day-one levels and mapping official
   questions to our types. Do not build the two nice-to-haves that would need the signed-in Student Question Bank: resolving a
   Student-bank question ID when a student logs a missed official question (public-index IDs still work), and per-question
   "open on College Board" deep links. A plain link to College Board's Question Bank home is fine.

7. **A calm, quiet interface: show only what the student needs (2026-09-27).** The user: "lets show students stuff that they
   only really indeed need to know ... make it easy and less tiring for eyes. convinience matters". Every page follows this:
   - Show what the student needs to decide or act on now. Hide zeros and defaults ("0 open", "Not practised", "0 of 107
     types ready", "Easy Medium Hard" when all are on); show a count only when it says something.
   - One number per idea, said once. Never repeat a fact in two places on the same screen (a selection shown by checkmarks is
     not also listed as chips; "Not started" is not beside "Not practised").
   - Details on demand, one tap away: expand a row, hover or focus for a tooltip, or open a Details / Settings sheet. Settings
     summaries collapse into one control; explanatory sentences become tooltips or help, not permanent text.
   - Easy on the eyes: generous spacing, few text sizes and weights, the primary fact in normal ink, secondary facts muted, mono
     only for numbers that matter, orange only for the one action or state that needs attention.
   - No feature is removed (this is not minimalism; decision 4 still holds): everything stays reachable and fast to use.
